      <description>TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. The three-way handshake is a fundamental part of TCP. It is a process that is used to establish a connection between two devices before they can exchange data.
When a client wants to initiate a connection with a server, it sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server. This packet contains a sequence number that is used to keep track of the order of the packets during the transmission.</description>

      <title>Are Cloud Certifications worth it?</title>

      <description>So the most valuable cloud engineers or developers in many established organizations don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have loads of certifications. Instead they bring extensive experience in IT infrastructure and have hands on experience with cloud and a habit of self-taught learning. I think there are two sides to cloud certifications and I do want to cover both.
Pros I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the pros, cloud certifications or certifications in general in IT, this has been a long going debate and just like everything there are upsides and downsides.</description>

      <description>How did I become a DevOps Engineer Hey friends üëã
I wanted to talk about my journey from cloud engineer to devops engineer, some of you already know bit about my career trajectory from help-desk to cloud engineer and then to DevOps engineer. If you would like to know what DevOps is, check out my article - What Is DevOps? What does a DevOps Engineer do?
So I stayed in the cloud engineering role for almost two years before I got into DevOps and I made this tweet just to give people perspective on what were some things that I focused on during my cloud engineering role to move to DevOps.</description>

And did I mention I was on the Microsoft Reactor Session with Gwyneth Pena on Deploy a Containerized App with Azure App Service. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the demo, where we install Grafana on an Ubuntu VM and use NGINX as a reverse proxy to serve it.</description>

So for quite a while now, I have been using WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux. It was really impressive to see this from Microsoft and I ever since then, I have loved it for development. So in today&amp;rsquo;s blog I will be sharing how I utilize it with VSCode.
What is WSL? The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment &amp;ndash; including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications &amp;ndash; directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.</description>

Demo You can curl the REST API to view my resume
curl -L https://myapphttp.azurewebsites.net/resume

      <description>Tick tock. Tick tock.üïê
As the clock ticks on, with a deafening silence we have never known before, like many of us, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to sit and count those seconds scrolling by.
Time ain&amp;rsquo;t really money (I mean we should have been rich by that logic long time back) but it sure is an opportunity.
So, I decided to put this period of lockdown to unlock more of my potential, by diving into the clouds!</description>
